This directory contains the Gnucap snapshots

Gnucap is a modular mixed-signal circuit simulator that partially implements
Verilog-AMS, that aspires to eventually implement the complete language.

The full manual is available as a wiki at http://gnucap.org.

This project is funded through the NGI0 Entrust Fund, a fund established by
NLnet with financial support from the European Commission's Next Generation
Internet programme, under the aegis of DG Communications Networks, Content and
Technology under grant agreement No 101069594.

== Build and Installation

See INSTALL. (INSTALL.old for old notes)

== Release notes

See NEWS

== Structure, since 2013-04-23

The code is split into sections "include", "lib", "apps", "main", "modelgen"

"include" contains the headers defining the public interface.

"main" is a simple main program "gnucap" that dynamically links to
libgnucap.

"lib" is the core library "libgnucap.so", required for all programs in
the gnucap collection.  This library can also be used with different
front-ends, possibly in other languages.

"apps" is a set of plugins that are loaded by default.  It builds
"libgnucap-default-plugins.so".  The ".cc" files here are mostly
independent of each other.  To add or remove one of them from the
build, just edit "MakeList" and recompile.  Alternatively, any of them
can be extracted and built separately.

"modelgen" is the old model compiler, which now links to libgnucap.so.

Installation (still "make install") installs the parts as expected.
It also installs the header files in $PREFIX/include/gnucap, to build
plugins.

\section{{\tt F}: Current Controlled Current Source}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Syntax}
\begin{verse}
{\tt F}{\it xxxxxxx n+ n-- ce} {\it value}\\
{\tt F}{\it xxxxxxx n+ n-- ce} {\it expression}\\
{\tt .CCCS} {\it label n+ n-- ce} {\it expression}
\end{verse}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Purpose}

Current controlled current source, or current gain block.
%------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Comments}

{\it N+} and {\it n--} are the positive and negative element (output)
nodes, respectively.  Current flow is from the positive node,
through the source, to the negative node.  {\it Ce} is the name of
an element through which the controlling current flows.  The
direction of positive controlling current is from the positive
node, through the element, to the negative node of {\it ce}.  {\it
Value} is the transconductance in mhos.

The controlling element can be any simple two terminal element.
Unlike SPICE, it does not need to be a voltage source.

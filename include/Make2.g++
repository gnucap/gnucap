# If you are porting and using g++, you should use this file as a start,
#	for a "release" version, optimized with run-time tracing removed.
# If you get errors or warnings, make a copy of it and modify that.
# For the first cut, use "Make2.Debug" as the start for more tracing,
#	or "Make2.Trace" for an extreme amount of tracing.
# After it works, use the file "Make2.g++" as a start for 
#	executable to use.
# If the port is non-trivial, check with me first because someone else
#	may have already done it.
# If it works without changes, send me a note so I can put it in the docs.
# Please send the changes to aldavis@gnu.org

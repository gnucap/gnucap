# warnings turned off, because they warn of nothing wrong
# 4.3
#-Wswitch-default -- lack of default is correct with enum
#-Wfloat-equal -- warns on NA, div by zero trap
#-Wpadded -- a bool in a class is enough
#-Wredundant-decls -- in both header and func is an error check
#-Wmissing-declarations -- pascal style
#-Wmissing-noreturn -- warns when always throws exception
#-Wunreachable-code -- warns even if reachable .. compiler bug??
#-Waggregate-return -- warns even if passed by reference
#-Wunsafe-loop-optimizations -- if can't unroll a loop
#-Winline
#-Wdisabled-optimization -- -O0 disables optimization, so it warns

# 4.2
#-Wpadded -- a bool in a class is enough
#-Winline
#-Waggregate-return -- warns even if passed by reference
#-Wfloat-equal -- warns on NA, div by zero trap
#-Wredundant-decls -- in both header and func is an error check
#-Wunsafe-loop-optimizations -- warns on any loop with variable count

# warnings turned off, because of the public headers
#-Wunreachable-code -- didn't use nonportable syntax to hide
#-Wmissing-noreturn -- didn't use nonportable syntax to hide

# warnings turned off, issues with clang
#-Wlogical-op -- not recognized
#-Wsign-conversion -- int to size_t
#-Wunused-const-variable -- generated code

# warnings that should be on, but ...
#-Wshadow -- lambda functions
#------------------------------------------------------------
# If you are porting and using g++, you should use this file as a start,
#	for a "debug" version, with extra warnings and run-time tracing.
# If you get errors or warnings, make a copy of it and modify that.
# After it works, use the file "Make2.g++" as a start for 
#	executable to use.
# If the port is non-trivial, check with me first because someone else
#	may have already done it.
# If it works without changes, send me a note so I can put it in the docs.
# Please send the changes to aldavis@gnu.org

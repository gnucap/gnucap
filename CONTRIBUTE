Thanks for wanting to contribute to Gnucap

Gnucap is designed as a modular system around a core library. The core library
is considered stable. Most user functionality is implemented as plugins, and
this includes all device models, (model) language support, simulation commands
and more.

Consequently, you are not generally required to request our approval for your
contribution. You may share and distribute your own creation following common
practice. We are always happy to give feedback and help, provided your code is
made available under a GPLv3-or-later compatible license.

Sometimes changes to the core library are needed to achieve certain goals.
Also, changes to plugins included with the main package can be worthwhile. In
either case, please get in touch, or preferably through the developer mailing
list [1].

Various features are developped in separate repositories and/or distributed as
separate packages. The most official ones can be found here [2].  For further
resources, technical details and conventions, see [3].
